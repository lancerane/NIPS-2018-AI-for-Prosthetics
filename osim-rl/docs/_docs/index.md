This repository contains software required for participation in the NIPS 2018 Challenge: AI for prosthetics. See more details about the challenge [here](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/nips-2018-ai-for-prosthetics).

In this competition, you are tasked with developing a controller to enable a physiologically-based human model to navigate a complex obstacle course as quickly as possible. You are provided with a human musculoskeletal model and a physics-based simulation environment where you can synthesize physically and physiologically accurate motion. Potential obstacles include external obstacles like steps, or a slippery floor, along with internal obstacles like muscle weakness or motor noise. You are scored based on the distance you travel through the obstacle course in a set amount of time.

To model physics and biomechanics we use [OpenSim](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core) - a biomechanical physics environment for musculoskeletal simulations.
